## Project Description
This project aims to build a music recommendation system that analyzes user input, performs sentiment analysis, and recommends songs based on the user's emotions or the vibe of a reference song. The system will allow users to input their feelings or request songs with a similar vibe to a given track

### Example Use Case
1. **User Input:** “I am feeling really sad because I lost my mum. Give me songs.”
   - **System Response:** The model performs sentiment analysis on the user's input and recommends songs that match the sad sentiment.
   
2. **User Input:** “Recommend songs that give the same vibe as ‘16’ by Baby Keem.”
   - **System Response:** The system recommends songs with similar sonic or emotional characteristics.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (or Next.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (or PostgreSQL)
- **ML Model:** Python (Flask/FastAPI) for sentiment analysis and song recommendation
- **API:** Spotify API (for fetching song data) or other music APIs
